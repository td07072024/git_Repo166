The ancient Greeks and ancient Romans were the first to name bison as such; the 2nd-century AD authors Pausanias and Oppian referred to them as βίσων, bisōn.[7] Earlier, in the 4th century BC, during the Hellenistic period, Aristotle referred to bison as βόνασος, bónasos.[7] He also noted that the Paeonians called it μόναπος (monapos).[8] Claudius Aelianus, writing in the late 2nd or early 3rd centuries AD, also referred to the species as βόνασος, and both Pliny the Elder's Natural History and Gaius Julius Solinus used Latin: bĭson and bonāsus.[7] Both Martial and Seneca the Younger mention bison (pl. bisontes).[7] Later Latin spellings of the term included visontes, vesontes, and bissontes.[7]

John Trevisa is the earliest author cited by the Oxford English Dictionary as using, in his 1398 translation of Bartholomeus Anglicus's De proprietatibus rerum, the Latin plural bisontes in English, as "bysontes" (Middle English: byſontes and bysountes).[7] Philemon Holland's 1601 translation of Pliny's Natural History, referred to "bisontes". The marginalia of the King James Version gives "bison" as a gloss for the Biblical animal called the "pygarg" mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy.[7] Randle Cotgrave's 1611 French–English dictionary notes that bison was already in use in French, and it may have influenced the adoption of the word into English; alternatively, it may have been borrowed directly from Latin.[7] John Minsheu's 1617 lexicon, Ductor in linguas, gives a definition for Bíson in Early Modern English: "a wilde oxe, great eied, broad-faced, that will neuer be tamed".
